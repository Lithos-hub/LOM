## THE CONTEXT 

Humanity has been dominated by machines. The Leader of the Machines (a.k.a. LOM), gives you the opportunity to go back in time and reverse this situation.

To do so, you will have to pass a test of only ten questions.

Now, the future of humanity is in your hands.

P.S.: npm run dev to have fun!
